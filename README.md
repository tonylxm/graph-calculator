# Graph Calculator

- Represents graphs using object-oriented concepts
- Implement common data structures and understand their complexity.
- JUnit testing
- BFS and DFS algorithms (both iterative and recursive implementations)
- Can calculate graph relations: symmetric, reflexive, transitive and equivalence class.
